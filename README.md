# Overview

This finance manager is a simple terminal application that allows the user to view and/or create products and purchase orders.
The created items are stored in JSON files which are read to display the information to the terminal.
When creating a purchase order the program pulls from the products file allowing the user to add existing products to their order.

I created this program as a way to further my understanding of C#.
